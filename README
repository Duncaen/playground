==========

Sandbox, container or (whatever you want to call it) utilities for linux.

There is still a lot to do, `pledge` should already work, but it might be
renamed later to be not confused with a similar api for a different OS.
At the moment `newns` is just an idea with some very basic code that does
not even compile and some docs on how or what it should do.

Usage
-----

To just restrict the allowed syscalls:

	$ pledge -p "proc rpath" sh

To create a new "container" (unshare all possible namespaces) and share the
base filesystem (/{bin,sbin,lib,var,usr,etc}) with it:

	$ newns -f "base container" sh

Or both together:

	$ newns -f "base container" pledge -p "proc rpath" sh

Install
-------

	$ make
	# make install
